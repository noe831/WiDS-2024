# WiDS-2024
WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenge #2

# Background: Equity in Healthcare
Women in Data Science (WiDS) Worldwide is on a mission to increase participation of women in data science to benefit societies worldwide. Healthcare inequity is a global challenge. Addressing this challenge has an extensive positive impact on women’s health, which is key for societies and economies to thrive. This datathon is designed to help you discover whether disparate treatments exist and to understand the drivers of those biases, such as demographic and societal factors.

# Overview: The Dataset and Challenge
Gilead Sciences provided a rich, real-world dataset which contains information about demographics, diagnosis and treatment options, and insurance provided about patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer. The dataset originated from Health Verity, one of the largest healthcare data ecosystems in the US. It was enriched with third party geo-demographic data to provide views into the socio economic aspects that may contribute to health equity. The dataset was then further enriched with zip code level climate data.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the research, development, and commercialization of medicines, primarily in the fields of virology, infectious diseases, oncology, and other areas of unmet medical need. At Gilead, we are committed to creating a healthier world for everyone. And ​​​​​​​through bold and transformative science, we’re driving innovation that has the potential to become the next generation of life-changing medicines.

# Task
The goal of this project is to predict the duration of time it takes for patients to receive metastatic cancer diagnosis.

Metastatic TNBC is considered the most aggressive TNBC and requires urgent and timely treatment. Unnecessary delays in diagnosis and subsequent treatment can have devastating effects in these difficult cancers. Differences in the wait time to get treatment is a good proxy for disparities in healthcare access.

The primary goal of building these models is to detect relationships between demographics of the patient with the likelihood of getting timely treatment. The secondary goal is to see if climate patterns impact proper diagnosis and treatment.

# Methodology
Primary analysis will utilize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The RMSE is a commonly used measure of the differences between predicted values provided by a model and the actual observed values.
